**1. Using a safe browser**<br>
Obviously, a key component of searching the internet is the browser itself. Sadly, many popular browsers these days hold on and spread your information. We advise against using browsers like Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge or Comet. To easily find out which apps store your data we recommend searching online or use an app to clean your registry.<br><br>
**2. VPNs**<br>
Another good tip is using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) to change your location and become protected from hackers and other cybercriminals. VPNs hide your device under a different IP address which makes it harder for people to track.<br><br>
**3. Cleaning your registry**<br>
Another good way to stay safe online is downloading a trusted scanning program. This allows you to find and safely remove malicious files that Windows Defender doesn’t find. Remember that even files marked as “system files” can monitor your archives.<br><br>
**4. Privacy**<br>
One of the simplest, yet often ignored rules of using the internet is the feeling of responsibility. It isn’t directly tied to online safety, but it’s worth keeping in mind that your IP address is left everywhere, even in the most embarrassing sites. So it’s worth it to keep your browsing history clean and private.<br><br>
**5. Using an Adblocker**<br>
The next practical gadget for everyday use is an adblocker. Besides the obvious effect of no more pop ups, it can save you from windows that would direct you to harmful websites or install malicious software onto your computer. Today, many private web browsers already have adblockers built in.<br><br>
**6. Common sense**<br>
In order to browse the web “healthily” it’s necessary to have an idea of how safe the sites you go on actually are. If the website is filled with ads, gets blocked by your system defenses it’s likely a scam or virus.<br><br>
**7. Reading the privacy policy**<br>
Many people simply accept the cookies and terms of service without reading them. This however is not advised because there may be things that put your information at risk or are simply not worth accepting.<br><br>
**8. Check your settings**<br>
A lot of popular apps or websites often have harmful or dangerous settings turned on by default such as Messenger sending your conversations to Meta AI. It is crucial to check settings in case some of them put your privacy at risk.<br><br>
**9. Sharing photos and videos**<br>
Sharing photographs with others online is a pretty broad topic, but it’s generally a bad idea to do so. Remember that that one picture you posted can end up all over the internet and get into the hands of people like pedophiles. When sending photos of yourself, your family or anything you consider private, proceed with caution.<br><br>
**10. Don't be stupid**<br>
Today we have many social media portals for talking and discussing with other people, Reddit, X and threads are just a few examples. The internet is the biggest place to share controversial opinions, we recommend keeping your harsh views to yourself or expressing them in real conversations.
